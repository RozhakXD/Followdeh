### What is Followdeh?
[**Followdeh**](https://github.com/RozhakXD/Followdeh) is a tools that you can use to get LIKES, COMMENTS and FOLLOWERS on Threads using an exchange system with other users.

You can get some FOLLOWERS by following some users first.

### Termux command?
First you must have the [Termux](https://f-droid.org/repo/com.termux_118.apk) to run this script and for how to use it can be seen on [**Youtube**](https://youtube.com/rozhakid). Then you enter this command into termux!
```
$ apt update -y && apt upgrade -y
$ pkg install git python-pip
$ git clone https://github.com/RozhakXD/Followdeh
$ cd "Followdeh"
$ python -m pip install -r requirements.txt
$ python Run.py
```

```
$ cd "$HOME/Followdeh" && git pul
$ python Run.py
```

### Why login failed?
- Because the cookies you entered are not yet registered in Threads.
- Maybe you entered your Threads account cookies incorrectly or the cookies have expired.
- You can try to replace the cookie threads with others.
- Your threads account cookies are logged out.
- Your threads have been disabled by the developer or checkpointed.

### FOLLOWERS, LIKES and COMMENTS not arriving?
- One of the problems is that our system does not have users to make exchanges.
- Because your account is in private mode so you cannot get likes, comments or followers.
- Our users have already sent followers or likes so they can't send any more.
- Maybe the post link format or username format that you entered is wrong.

### Why did LIKES, COMMENTS and FOLLOWERS drop?
- The threads system detects spam on your account so they delete likes, comments or followers on your account.
- Maybe their Threads account was disabled or spammed.
- Their threads are blocked or disabled by the developer so they automatically cancel likes, comments or following your account.

### Requirements for logging in?
- We require accounts to use two-factor authentication for added security.
- You should not use your main account or accounts with large followers.
- You must use a new account or a fake account to log in.

### Cookies logged out?
- You can complete your account with two-factor authentication, email and phone number to avoid spam detection.
- Your account must be online in the browser where you retrieve the cookies.
- Complete your account with a profile photo, biography and several posts.

### No cookies collected?
One of the problems we face is if there are no users in our system, so other users cannot exchange the services we provide. This becomes a problem if there are no users then automatically cookies cannot be obtained or scraped.

```python
print("Good luck hope it works!")
